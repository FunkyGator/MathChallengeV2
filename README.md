# MathChallengeV2

This is a Math Challenge game that began as a tutorial from The C# Academy - https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/

The first tutorial for it was a console version. After that it progressed to the MAUI version (Windows only) that I have here. The tutorial only consisted of games 
for the four operators and had a more limited View Previous Games page.

I added the number of questions option, the difficulty option, the random operator game, and enhanced the View Previous Games page to include more details and another page that shows
the game details for each game including the questions that were asked, the answer that was given and what the result was.

Math Challenge is a very simple game but as I am a beginner programmer that is trying to teach himself it helped me to learn and better understand several concepts
of programming that I have struggled with in the past.  I developed a better understanding of OOP, SQLite integration, dependency injection, respositiories, data models,
the .net MAUI framework, XAML, and some other concepts that I struggled with.
