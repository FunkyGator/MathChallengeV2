# MathChallengeV2

This started as a tutorial from the C# Academy.
After completing the tutorial I continued to work on it and added a new game mode, several enhancements to the game itself, and added some more detail
to the View Previous Games page.

I am attempting to learn C# on my own and this project was a major stepup for me on my journey.  Before this I was creating small projects in the console with
very limited functionality.

Through this project I learned more about OOP, SQlite integration, repositories, dependency injection, the MAUI environment, data models, and several other
concepts.  While I still have much to learn I really feel like I turned a page with this project.
